**1. Primary data cleaning, preparation and exploration**
Data Integrity Checks: Perform sanity checks for anomalies, outliers, and missing values and document how I have handled them.


**2. Create scope and objectives**
   Using this data, I can perform a variety of analyses:

**Trend Analysis:** Look at the historical data to identify trends in consumption and emissions. This could involve comparing the growth of different types of energy consumption or looking at how energy consumption and CO2 emissions correlate.

**Comparative Analysis:** Compare data between countries or regions to see which are the biggest consumers or producers of different energy types and which are making the most significant shifts toward renewable energy.

**Correlation Studies:** Investigate the relationship between energy consumption (or specific types of energy consumption) and CO2 emissions to understand the environmental impact of different energy sources.

**Forecasting:** Using historical data, I might attempt to forecast future energy consumption and emissions patterns, which could be particularly insightful for policy-making and planning purposes.

**Efficiency and Development:** Evaluate energy consumption per capita and consider how it relates to economic development, efficiency advancements, and technology changes.

**Policy Impact Assessment:** Assess the impact of major policy implementations on energy consumption patterns and emissions, such as the introduction of carbon taxes or subsidies for renewable energy.

**Sustainability Analysis:** Examine the growth of renewable energy sources in the context of global sustainability goals and the transition away from fossil fuels.

It’s crucial to consider the context behind the numbers—like economic growth, population changes, technological advances, and shifts in policy. These factors can greatly influence energy consumption and CO2 emissions.
